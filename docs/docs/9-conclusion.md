# Summary
You now know how to deploy a three tier application to Kubernetes. You've seen how to create containers, deploy those into a Kubernetes cluster, and how to leverage the MongoDB Atlas Operator to create and manage clusters from Kubernetes. 

If you are using MongoDB Enterprise instead of Atlas, there is also an [Operator](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/enterprise-kubernetes-operator) available which works in very similar fashion.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joel__lord).

You now know how to deploy a three tier application to Kubernetes. You've seen how to create containers, deploy those into a Kubernetes cluster, and how to leverage the MongoDB Atlas Operator to create and manage clusters from Kubernetes. 

If you are using MongoDB Enterprise instead of Atlas, there is also an Operator available which works in very similar fashion.

If you have question, don't hesitate to hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joel__lord).

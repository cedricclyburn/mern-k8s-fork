# What is MongoDB Atlas

So far, the focus has been on local setup. The containers were all running locally, and it was easy to use. However, there will come a point where you will most likely want to connect to a database that is shared with your colleagues. Or you will most likely want to connect to a reliable, scalable, and resilient database once you launch your application into production. This is where MongoDB Atlas will come into play. 

MongoDB Atlas is a full application data platform that includes the database your love. In the course of this workshop, we won't be exploring any of the developer features that the platform has to offer, but be sure to check out MongoDB World's keynote to learn more about the platform.
